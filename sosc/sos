// The list of files (as well as their input and output directories) that you want compiled goes here.
// The input directory defaults to "_sossource" without the quotes.
// The output directory defaults to "_sosbuild" without the quotes.
// The input and output directories are both not mandatory -- if one or both is missing, they are defaulted as shown above.
// Otherwise, put them on the line below their respective marker.

// The files go after the file marker and do not require an extension (but it is okay to have one).
